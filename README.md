DAD Project 2021


To run our project you need to run dotnet build on the main directory.
Then navigate to the PCS folder and run dotnet run.
Finally, navigate to the PuppetMaster folder and run dotnet run if you want to insert the commands yourself, or you can run
dotnet run < <name_of_file> to run commands from a file.

The report is on the "Report" folder.
